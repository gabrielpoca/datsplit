# DatSplit

In this project I'm trying to recreate the primitives behind Splitwise to run
in a decentralized web application.

To access the live version you need to download the [Beaker
Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and open [DatSplit](dat://datsplit-gabrielpoca.hashbase.io/).

If you're interested in this project please reach out on the issues or on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/gabrielgpoca).

## Requirments

The only single thing you need to run this is [Beaker
Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/). Before anything else you should install
it. It's a peer-to-peer browser that allows our applications to communicate
directly with one another, there's no need for a server. I'm very interested in
what kind of tools we can build with this. I'm using their `DatArchive API`
that's build on top of the Dat protocol.

For the [live version please visit this link on the Beaker
Browser](dat://datsplit-gabrielpoca.hashbase.io/).
